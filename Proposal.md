## Strengths of our team and its members:

Team: We know each other pretty well, and we can collaborate on the project efficiently.

Charlie: My coding skill is strong and I am good at time management.

Hank: I have previous software/code project experience, so I am willing to coordinate the work between group members to make the process more efficient.

Lee: I have good debugging skills and creativity.

Austin: I have effective searching skills and good will of coordination.

## Ways to capitalize on the strengths of each member:

We will designate specific roles to make our meetings more structured and run more smoothly. However, since the exact work for the project is unknown at this point, we will assign specific roles for project work (which will possibly rotate) when it actually starts. We will rotate roles so that everyone can have experience of different roles for software development.

## Meeting time and location:

We will meet twice a week, two hours each, normally on Wednesdays and Sundays afternoons in Olin CS lab.

## Roles and responsibilities (in meetings & discussions):

Charlie: setting agendas, contact with team members

Hank: facilitate discussion

Lee: note-taking, summarizing a to-do list for after the meeting

Austin: manage and look up all the code base/ database for reference in meeting
